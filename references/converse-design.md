# Converse direction (B10–B12): design decision and formalization boundary

Taxis issue **#53** — *Converse direction: curves with a Belyi map descend to `ℚ̄`*.
This is the second half of Belyi's theorem (`references/proof-outline.md`, statements
**B10 → B11 → B12**, feeding on the rigidity input **B9** of issue #52). This document is
the issue's **first deliverable**: it fixes *what is proved vs. what is axiomatized*, the
exact Lean statement of **B12**, the interfaces of the axiomatized inputs, and the split
into child issues. It is a proposal for maintainer sign-off before any large-scale proof
work, and it mirrors the shape of the already-approved `references/rigidity-design.md`
(the analogous first deliverable of #52).

## 0. TL;DR of the decision

* The converse rests on **three** pieces of infrastructure that are genuinely far from
  mathlib v4.32 and are, individually, research-grade: **B9** (rigidity/finiteness of
  covers — Riemann existence; already axiomatized in `Belyi/Rigidity.lean` per #52),
  **B10** (spreading out a Belyi pair to a family over a `ℚ̄`-variety — EGA IV limit
  formalism), and the **faithfully-flat descent infrastructure** (B3c/B3d/B2b, issues
  #167/#168/#183) needed to recognise the special ℚ̄-fibre as a genuine curve model of `X`
  and to match branch loci.
* Following the precedent set by #52 for B9, the converse is formalized against a **fixed,
  clearly-named interface of sanctioned axioms/hypotheses** for the mathlib-absent inputs,
  with the **actual Köck rigidity argument (B11)** — the mathematical content that is
  *not* a generic EGA fact — carried as far as the interface allows. Concretely:
  - **B10** is packaged as a Lean **`structure SpreadOut`** bundling the output of
    spreading out (a family `𝒳 ⟶ ℙ¹_U ⟶ U` over a dense open `U` of a smooth affine
    `ℚ̄`-variety, with Belyi fibres and a generic-fibre identification), plus **one
    sanctioned axiom** `belyi_spreadOut` producing such a structure from a Belyi pair over
    `ℂ`. This isolates the EGA limit formalism exactly as `rigidity_finiteness` isolates
    Riemann existence.
  - **B11** (the rigidity/isotriviality step) consumes `rigidity_finiteness` (#52) together
    with a `SpreadOut` datum and produces a `ℚ̄`-point `u ∈ U(ℚ̄)` whose fibre is
    isomorphic, over `ℙ¹`, to the geometric generic fibre — hence to `(X, f)` after base
    change. The *combinatorics* of "finitely many iso-classes ⇒ constant on a dense open ⇒
    a ℚ̄-point works" is where genuine Lean content lives; the precise constructibility /
    isom-scheme input from [Koeck2004, Thm 2.2] is itself partly axiomatized (see §3).
  - **B12** assembles B10 + B11 into `DefinableOverPair ℚ̄ ℂ X f` (pair version) and
    `DefinableOver ℚ̄ ℂ X` (scheme version), the exact predicates the forward direction
    produces and the main theorem #55 consumes.
* **Honest scope.** With mathlib v4.32 this design does **not** yield an axiom-free converse;
  it yields a converse **modulo a small, explicitly enumerated set of sanctioned axioms**
  (B9 rigidity — already sanctioned; B10 spreading-out; and the B11 isom-scheme
  constructibility input), each isolated in one named place, plus the descent bricks of
  #167/#168 for the fibre-recognition step. The forward direction (#51) stays axiom-free.
  The main theorem #55 will therefore be `belyi_iff` **relative to the sanctioned axioms**,
  with `#print axioms` enumerating exactly `rigidity_finiteness`, `belyi_spreadOut`, and the
  B11 input — nothing else.

## 1. The mathematical statements (recap of the outline)

Fix `ℚ̄ ⊆ ℂ` (`ℚ̄ = AlgebraicClosure ℚ` with a fixed embedding, as the outline's B14b notes,
so no choice-of-embedding invariance is needed). Let `(X, f : X ⟶ ℙ¹_ℂ)` be a Belyi pair
over `ℂ` with `X` a curve.

* **(B10) Spreading out.** `(X, f)` is of finite presentation, hence definable over a
  subfield `L ⊆ ℂ` finitely generated over `ℚ̄`. Writing `L = ℚ̄(V)` for a smooth affine
  `ℚ̄`-variety `V`, spread `(X_L, f_L)` out to a family `𝒳 ⟶ ℙ¹_U ⟶ U` over a dense open
  `U ⊆ V` such that every closed fibre `(𝒳_u, f_u)` (`u ∈ U`) is a Belyi pair over `ℚ̄` and
  the generic fibre base-changed to `ℂ` recovers `(X, f)`. [Koeck2004, §2; standard
  spreading-out; Szamuely2009, §4.8.]

* **(B11) Descent through the family (rigidity/isotriviality).** By B9 over `ℚ̄(V)‾` there
  are only finitely many degree-`≤ d` covers of `ℙ¹` étale outside `{0,1,∞}` up to iso, so
  the family `𝒳/U` is isotrivial on a dense open: the geometric generic fibre is isomorphic
  as a cover to `𝒳_u` for a closed point `u ∈ U(ℚ̄)`. [Koeck2004, Thm 2.2] realises this via
  the isomorphism scheme `Isom_U(𝒳, 𝒳')` being of finite type over `U`, whose image is
  constructible and, if dominant, contains a dense open with a `ℚ̄`-point.

* **(B12) Converse.** Hence `X` (and the pair `(X, f)`) is definable over `ℚ̄`:
  `(𝒳_u, f_u) ×_ℚ̄ ℂ ≅ (X, f)` over `ℙ¹_ℂ`.

## 2. The Lean target statement (B12)

The forward direction delivers (`Belyi/Forward.lean`, `Belyi/ForwardPair.lean`):

```text
exists_isBelyiMap_of_isCurveOver (k) [IsAlgClosed k] [CharZero k] [Algebra.IsAlgebraic ℚ k]
    (X) [X.Over (Spec k)] [IsCurveOver k X] : ∃ f : X ⟶ P1 k, IsBelyiMap k f
exists_definableOverPair_isBelyiMap_baseChange_of_isCurveOver … : … DefinableOverPair k K …
```

The converse must produce the **same** predicates in the opposite direction. Target shape,
stated over the abstract field `K` playing the role of `ℂ` (an algebraically closed
characteristic-zero field containing the working `ℚ̄ = k`; the model case is `k = ℚ̄`,
`K = ℂ`):

```text
/-- **B12 (converse), pair version.** A Belyi pair over `ℂ` is definable over `ℚ̄`. -/
theorem definableOverPair_of_isBelyiMap
    (k K) [Field k] [IsAlgClosed k] [CharZero k] [Algebra.IsAlgebraic ℚ k]
    [Field K] [IsAlgClosed K] [CharZero K] [Algebra k K]
    (X) [X.Over (Spec K)] [IsCurveOver K X]
    (f : X ⟶ P1 K) (hf : IsBelyiMap K f) :
    DefinableOverPair k K X f

/-- **B12 (converse), scheme version.** -/
theorem definableOver_of_exists_isBelyiMap … [IsCurveOver K X]
    (h : ∃ f : X ⟶ P1 K, IsBelyiMap K f) : DefinableOver k K X
```

The pair version implies the scheme version through `DefinableOverPair.definableOver`
(already merged). `DefinableOverPair k K X f` is the existence of a model
`f₀ : X₀ ⟶ ℙ¹_k` with base change identified with `f` — precisely the `(𝒳_u, f_u)` produced
by B11 with `X₀ := 𝒳_u`. **This is the interface contract**: B11 must hand back its `ℚ̄`-fibre
in exactly the `DefinableOverPair` shape (a model + a base-change identification), so the
final `exact` in B12 is definitional bookkeeping, not new mathematics.

## 3. The formalization boundary and the sanctioned interface

### 3a. B10 — two sub-steps: a *provable* descent-to-a-subfield, then an axiomatized family

B10 splits cleanly into two very different sub-steps, and the mathlib audit (§4) shows the
boundary between them falls **inside** B10, not at its edge:

* **B10(i) — definability over a finitely generated subfield `L ⊆ ℂ` (PROVABLE today).**
  "`(X, f)` is of finite presentation, hence definable over a subfield `L ⊆ ℂ` finitely
  generated over `ℚ̄`" is achievable against mathlib v4.32 via the
  `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/AffineTransitionLimit.lean` machinery (`Spec ℂ = lim Spec R_i`
  over the cofiltered diagram of `ℚ̄`-finitely-generated subalgebras; descend the finite-
  presentation morphism `f` and the scheme `X` to some stage, recover `(X, f)` by base
  change). This produces `DefinableOverPair L ℂ X f` (and `DefinableOver L ℂ X`) for some
  intermediate `ℚ̄ ⊆ L ⊆ ℂ` with `L/ℚ̄` finitely generated. See §4 for the exact lemma names;
  this is real, sorry-free, axiom-free Lean and is the converse's genuinely provable nugget.
* **B10(ii) — spreading `L = ℚ̄(V)` out to a family with good fibres (RESEARCH-GRADE).**
  Realising `L` as the function field of a smooth affine `ℚ̄`-variety `V` and propagating the
  Belyi-pair property from the generic fibre to a dense open `U ⊆ V` of closed `ℚ̄`-fibres is
  EGA IV constructibility/openness-of-good-fibres, absent from mathlib (§4). This is the part
  packaged and axiomatized.

Spreading out to a family with good fibres (B10(ii)) is EGA IV §8–§17 limit formalism.
Mathlib v4.32 has a **starting toolkit** but not the specific outputs (see §4). We therefore
**package the output** and **axiomatize its existence**, exactly as B9 axiomatizes finiteness:

```text
/-- The data produced by spreading out a Belyi pair `(X, f)` over `K = ℂ` to a family over a
dense open of a smooth affine `ℚ̄`-variety.  All fibres over closed `ℚ̄`-points are Belyi
pairs; the generic fibre base-changed to `K` recovers `(X, f)`. -/
structure SpreadOut (k K) [Field k] … [Algebra k K] (X) (f : X ⟶ P1 K) where
  base       : Scheme          -- U, a smooth affine ℚ̄-variety (dense open of V)
  [baseOver  : base.Over (Spec k)]
  total      : Scheme          -- 𝒳
  fibreMap   : total ⟶ …       -- 𝒳 ⟶ ℙ¹_U over U
  -- every closed ℚ̄-point u ∈ U gives a Belyi pair (𝒳_u, f_u) over ℚ̄:
  fibre_isBelyi : ∀ u : (Spec k ⟶ base), IsBelyiMap k (fibreAt … u)
  fibre_isCurve : ∀ u : …, IsCurveOver k (fibreAt … u).left
  -- degree bound d (so B9 applies) and the generic-fibre / base-change identification to (X, f):
  deg_le     : ∀ u, degree (fibreAt … u) ≤ d
  generic_eq : DefinableOverPair k K X f  -- "the geometric generic fibre is (X,f)", after ℚ̄(V)‾

/-- **B10 (spreading out), axiomatized.**  Every Belyi pair over `K = ℂ` spreads out. -/
axiom belyi_spreadOut (k K) … (X) [IsCurveOver K X] (f) (hf : IsBelyiMap K f) :
    Nonempty (SpreadOut k K X f)
```

The exact field list is design work for the child issue (§4, #53a): it must be *just enough*
for B11 to run and for B12's final identification. Notably `generic_eq` should be phrased so
that a specialization `u ∈ U(ℚ̄)` with `𝒳_u ≅ 𝒳_{generic geom}` yields `DefinableOverPair`.

**Alternative considered and rejected for now:** proving B10 from mathlib's
`SpreadingOut.lean`/`AffineTransitionLimit.lean` toolkit. This is a large, genuinely
research-grade effort (see §4) that also needs "write a f.g. field extension as the function
field of a smooth `ℚ̄`-variety" and openness of the good-fibre loci — neither in mathlib.
It is filed as a research-grade tracker (#53d) analogous to #194/#183, not a blocker.

### 3b. B11 — `Belyi/Descent.lean`: the rigidity argument

B11 is the one place with genuine, non-EGA mathematical content that should be *proved* to
the extent the interface allows. It consumes `rigidity_finiteness` (#52) and a `SpreadOut`
datum. The core combinatorial move — *finitely many iso-classes of fibres ⇒ the family is
isotrivial on a dense open ⇒ a `ℚ̄`-point realises the generic fibre* — rests on
[Koeck2004, Thm 2.2]'s **isomorphism-scheme constructibility** input:

> `Isom_U(𝒳, 𝒳' )` is of finite type over `U`; its image in `U` is constructible; if it
> meets the generic point it contains a dense open, which (over `ℚ̄`) has a `ℚ̄`-point.

Finiteness of type of `Isom_U` and constructibility of images (Chevalley) are, again, mostly
mathlib-absent at the required generality. The **decision** is to axiomatize the single clean
consequence B11 actually needs and prove the wrapper around it:

```text
/-- **B11 input (isom-scheme / isotriviality), axiomatized.** In a `SpreadOut` family whose
fibres fall (by B9) into finitely many iso-classes over `ℚ̄(V)‾`, some closed `ℚ̄`-point `u`
has fibre isomorphic over `ℙ¹` to the geometric generic fibre. -/
axiom spreadOut_isotrivial_point (S : SpreadOut k K X f) :
    ∃ u : (Spec k ⟶ S.base), BelyiCover.IsoRel k d (fibreCover S u) (genericGeomFibre S)
```

then **prove** `B11 : SpreadOut … → DefinableOverPair k K X f` by transporting the
identification, and **prove** B12 by `belyi_spreadOut` + B11. The reduction of
`spreadOut_isotrivial_point` to `rigidity_finiteness` (the actual "finitely many ⇒ dense
open" pigeonhole via constructibility) is recorded as the research-grade de-axiomatization
tracker (#53d). *If, on closer scoping, the pigeonhole from `Finite (BelyiCover.Iso)` to a
dense-open constant locus turns out formalizable given the `SpreadOut` interface, promote it
out of the axiom — that is the most valuable provable nugget in the converse and should be
attempted (#53c).*

### 3c. Descent bricks for fibre recognition (#167/#168)

B10's `fibre_isCurve`/`generic_eq` and B12's final identification implicitly use that a
`ℚ̄`-model of a `ℂ`-curve is itself a curve (**B3c descent**, #167) and that branch loci match
under base change (**B3d/B2b**, #168). These are the faithfully-flat descent statements whose
keystone (`SurjectiveOnStalks` codescent, #183) is documented as research-grade
(`references/rigidity-design.md` §5; memory `b2b-b3d-smoothlocus-basechange-mathlib-gap.md`).
The converse design **reuses** those issues rather than duplicating them: `SpreadOut` is
phrased to *carry* `IsCurveOver`/`IsBelyiMap` on the fibres as hypotheses (produced together
with the family by `belyi_spreadOut`), so the descent bricks are needed only where #167/#168
already track them, and B11/B12 do not re-derive them.

## 4. What mathlib v4.32 has for B10, and where the wall is

*(Inventory from a direct audit of `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/` at the pinned revision;
recorded on issue #53.)*

**The real workhorse — `AffineTransitionLimit.lean` (enables B10(i)).** For a cofiltered
diagram `D : I ⥤ Scheme` with affine transition maps and limit cone (`Spec ℂ = lim Spec R_i`
over the `ℚ̄`-finitely-generated subalgebras `R_i ⊆ ℂ`), the consumable lemmas are:

* `Scheme.exists_π_app_comp_eq_of_locallyOfFinitePresentation` — descend a
  finite-**presentation** morphism into `X` to a finite stage `D.obj i` (the clause "generic
  fibre recovers `(X,f)` after base change"); affine special case
  `..._of_isAffine`. Also the finite-**type** versions
  `exists_hom_comp_eq_comp_of_locallyOfFiniteType` / `exists_hom_hom_comp_...`.
* `Scheme.exists_isAffine_of_isLimit`, `exists_isQuasiAffine_of_isLimit`,
  `exists_isOpenCover_and_isAffine` / `_of_finite`,
  `Scheme.OpenCover.exists_of_isCofiltered_of_finite` — descend the scheme, an affine open
  cover, and affine opens to a finite stage.
* section/topology helpers: `exists_appTop_π_eq_of_isLimit`, `preservesColimit_yoneda`
  (`Hom_S(-,X)` preserves the cofiltered limit for `X` of finite presentation),
  `compactSpace_of_isLimit`, `nonempty_of_isLimit`.

This is enough to build `DefinableOver L ℂ X` / `DefinableOverPair L ℂ X f` for an f.g.
subfield `L` — **B10(i) is real assembly work, not new theory.** (Prerequisite caveat: the
finiteness-descent *converse* `f` finite ⇒ model finite is still open in-repo,
`Belyi/DefinablePairFinite.lean:19-20`, tracked on #48; needed if the model map is required
finite rather than merely finite-presentation.)

**Spreading a map out of a stalk — `SpreadingOut.lean`.** This file is germ-injectivity and
spreading a map out of `Spec 𝒪_{X,x}` to an open neighbourhood
(`spread_out_of_isGermInjective'`, `@[stacks 0BX6]`), *not* family spreading over a base.
Curves are integral ⇒ `IsGermInjective` is a free instance. Useful as a component, not the
theorem. (`Belyi/RationalMap.lean:20` already uses this primitive via `PartialMap`.)

**Descent plumbing — `Morphisms/Descent.lean`, `FlatDescent.lean`, `LocalFlatDescent.lean`.**
`MorphismProperty.DescendsAlong`/`CodescendsAlong` framework + descent instances for
`Surjective`/`UniversallyClosed`/… and `Smooth`/`Etale`/`LocallyOfFinitePresentation` along
`Surjective ⊓ Flat ⊓ QuasiCompact` — descent along a **fixed faithfully-flat cover**, not down
a filtered limit (see `references/rigidity-design.md` §2 and the memory descent notes for the
turnkey list and the missing bricks #167/#168/#183).

**The wall — B10(ii) and B11 (not in mathlib v4.32):**

* **No "finitely generated field extension = function field of a smooth affine variety".**
  Nothing takes an f.g. field `L/ℚ̄` and returns a smooth affine model variety `V` with
  `L = ℚ̄(V) = colim 𝒪(U_i)`. The limit machinery is available *once you have the diagram*,
  but building `V` and the identification is on you.
* **No openness/density of the good-fibre locus** (fibres = smooth proper curve + finite map
  + branch ⊆ `{0,1,∞}`) for a family over a base. No "finite locus is open", no
  "smooth-proper-curve locus is open", no constructibility of geometrically-integral fibres
  at this generality. This is the hard heart of B10(ii); mathlib gives nothing turnkey.
* **No isomorphism scheme `Isom_U` of finite type + Chevalley constructibility of its image**
  at the required generality (the B11 input of §3b).

Conclusion: the axiomatization boundary lies **inside** B10 — B10(i) is provable, while
B10(ii) and the B11 isom-scheme input are the correct things to axiomatize, in direct analogy
with B9. The descent bricks (#167/#168/#183) are a *separate*, already-tracked mathlib gap.

## 5. Child-issue split (proposed)

* **#53e — (PROVABLE, ready now) definability over a finitely generated subfield — B10(i).**
  `Belyi/DefinableSubfield.lean`: from a Belyi pair `(X, f)` over `ℂ` (more generally over any
  algebraically closed char-0 `K ⊇ ℚ̄`), of finite presentation, produce an intermediate
  `ℚ̄ ⊆ L ⊆ ℂ` with `L/ℚ̄` finitely generated and `DefinableOverPair L ℂ X f` (hence
  `DefinableOver L ℂ X`), via the `AffineTransitionLimit.lean` machinery (§4). Sorry-free and
  **axiom-free** — the converse's genuinely provable piece. Independent of B9/B10(ii)/B11 and
  of the descent bricks; can proceed immediately. (Mind the finiteness-descent caveat of §4 /
  #48: state the model map at the finite-presentation level, or first close
  `DefinablePairFinite`'s open converse.) Depends only on the merged definability API and #46.

* **#53a — `Belyi/SpreadOut.lean`: the `SpreadOut` structure + `belyi_spreadOut` axiom.**
  Fix the exact fields of `SpreadOut` against B11's needs; state the single spreading-out
  axiom, taking the finitely generated subfield `L` from **#53e** as its input (B10(ii)
  starts where B10(i) stops). Depends on #46/#47 (curve + Belyi API), the merged definability
  API, and #53e. Coordinate the interface with #53b before finalizing. This is the converse
  analogue of #52's #52a (the statement + isolated axiom).

* **#53b — `Belyi/Descent.lean`: B11 + B12 assembly against the interface.**
  Prove `B11 : SpreadOut → DefinableOverPair` (transport of the isotriviality point's
  identification) and `B12 : IsBelyiMap → DefinableOverPair`/`DefinableOver` from
  `belyi_spreadOut` + B11 + `spreadOut_isotrivial_point`. Sorry-free modulo the sanctioned
  axioms; `#print axioms` must list exactly the sanctioned set. Depends on #53a and #52
  (`Belyi/Rigidity.lean`).

* **#53c — (provable nugget, attempt) pigeonhole `Finite (BelyiCover.Iso) ⇒ isotrivial`.**
  Investigate whether, given the `SpreadOut` interface, the reduction of
  `spreadOut_isotrivial_point` to `rigidity_finiteness` — the "finitely many iso-classes over
  a connected base ⇒ constant on a dense open ⇒ a ℚ̄-point" step — is formalizable without the
  full isom-scheme machinery (e.g. via a countability/constructibility argument phrased on the
  `BelyiCover.Iso` quotient). If yes, this promotes the B11 input out of the axiom and is the
  single most valuable provable piece of the converse. If it bottoms out on Chevalley
  constructibility, record the wall and leave the axiom.

* **#53d — `[BLOCKED — research-grade]` de-axiomatize B10/B11.**
  Tracker for replacing `belyi_spreadOut` (EGA IV spreading out + generic smoothness of the
  base + openness of good-fibre loci) and `spreadOut_isotrivial_point` (isom-scheme finite
  type + Chevalley) by real proofs, gated on major mathlib additions. Off critical path;
  record the §4 wall so future scanners do not re-scope it. Analogous to #194 (B9) and #183.

## 6. Interaction with the rest of the project

* **Forward direction (#51)** is unaffected and remains axiom-free; nothing in `Belyi/Forward*`
  imports `Belyi/SpreadOut.lean` or `Belyi/Descent.lean`.
* **Main theorem (#55)** assembles `belyi_iff` from the forward `∃ f, IsBelyiMap` ⇐ side and
  the converse `⇒` side; with this design its `#print axioms` enumerates exactly
  `rigidity_finiteness` (#52), `belyi_spreadOut` and `spreadOut_isotrivial_point` (#53) — the
  sanctioned set — plus the classical `propext/Classical.choice/Quot.sound`. #55's
  definition-of-done ("no axioms beyond what the design documents explicitly sanction") is met
  by this document sanctioning the two converse axioms alongside `rigidity-design.md`'s B9.
* **Marked form (B13, #54)** is the *forward* marked strengthening and is independent of the
  converse; #55 re-exports it (B14c).
* **Descent infra (#167/#168/#183)** is reused, not duplicated: `SpreadOut` carries the fibre
  curve/Belyi data so the converse does not re-derive faithfully-flat descent.

**Honest overall assessment.** This design gives the converse a *fixed, buildable interface*
and isolates its mathlib-absent inputs into two clearly-named axioms (plus the already-
sanctioned B9), mirroring how `rigidity-design.md` handled B9. It does **not** by itself make
the converse axiom-free — that requires EGA IV spreading-out, Chevalley constructibility, and
the faithfully-flat descent bricks, all research-grade against mathlib v4.32. What it *does*
enable: (i) landing the B12 assembly (#53b) as sorry-free-modulo-sanctioned-axioms real Lean,
(ii) a scoped attempt (#53c) at the one genuinely provable rigidity nugget, and (iii) a clean
main theorem (#55) with a fully enumerated, sanctioned axiom set.
