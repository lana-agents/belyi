# Converse direction of Belyi's theorem (B11 + B12): descent to `ℚ̄`

This file assembles the **converse** direction of Belyi's theorem — statements **B11**
(rigidity/isotriviality) and **B12** (descent) of `references/proof-outline.md` — against
the sanctioned interface fixed in `references/converse-design.md`. It consumes:

* `Belyi.belyi_spreadOut` (B10(ii), `Belyi/SpreadOut.lean`) — spreading a Belyi pair out to
  a family with degree-`≤ d` Belyi fibres over a `ℚ̄`-variety;
* `Belyi.rigidity_finiteness` (B9, `Belyi/Rigidity.lean`) — finiteness of iso-classes of
  degree-`≤ d` Belyi covers;

and it introduces the last of the three sanctioned converse axioms,
`Belyi.spreadOut_isotrivial_point` (the B11 isom-scheme/isotriviality input).

## The rigidity argument (B11, [Koeck2004] Thm 2.2)

Given a `SpreadOut` family `𝒳/U` whose closed `ℚ̄`-fibres are degree-`≤ d` Belyi covers,
B9 says these fall into only finitely many iso-classes over `ℚ̄`. Köck's Theorem 2.2 then
forces the family to be **isotrivial on a dense open**: the isomorphism scheme
`Isom_U(𝒳, 𝒳')` is of finite type over `U`, its image is constructible (Chevalley), and,
being dominant, contains a dense open with a `ℚ̄`-point `u ∈ U(ℚ̄)` whose fibre realises the
geometric generic fibre — hence `(X, f)` after base change. So `(X, f)` descends to `ℚ̄`.

Finiteness of type of `Isom_U` and Chevalley constructibility of its image, at the required
generality, are **absent from mathlib v4.32** (see `references/converse-design.md` §4). We
therefore isolate the single clean consequence B11 needs as the sanctioned axiom
`spreadOut_isotrivial_point`, stated **taking the finiteness of iso-classes as an explicit
hypothesis** so that B9 (`rigidity_finiteness`) genuinely feeds it — and prove the wrapper
`definableOverPair_of_spreadOut` around it. (Whether the pigeonhole `Finite (BelyiCover.Iso)`
⇒ isotriviality is itself formalizable — promoting this axiom to a theorem — is the scoped
attempt of taxis #199; de-axiomatizing the full isom-scheme input is the research-grade
tracker #200.)

## Main statements

* `Belyi.spreadOut_isotrivial_point`: **sanctioned axiom** (B11 input) — a Belyi pair
  (`hf : IsBelyiMap K f`, `X` a curve) with a `SpreadOut` family and finitely many fibre
  iso-classes descends to `ℚ̄`. The `IsBelyiMap`/`IsCurveOver` hypotheses are what make this
  a *true* isolated statement (see the axiom's soundness note).
* `Belyi.definableOverPair_of_spreadOut` (B11): the proved wrapper feeding
  `rigidity_finiteness` into the axiom.
* `Belyi.definableOverPair_of_isBelyiMap` (**B12**, pair version): a Belyi pair over `ℂ` is
  definable over `ℚ̄`.
* `Belyi.definableOver_of_exists_isBelyiMap` (**B12**, scheme version): a curve over `ℂ`
  admitting a Belyi map is definable over `ℚ̄`.

Together with the forward direction (`Belyi/Forward.lean`, `Belyi/ForwardPair.lean`) these
are the two halves the main theorem (taxis #55) assembles into `belyi_iff`. By design,
`#print axioms definableOverPair_of_isBelyiMap` lists exactly the three sanctioned axioms
`rigidity_finiteness`, `belyi_spreadOut`, `spreadOut_isotrivial_point` (plus the classical
`propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound`) — nothing else.

/-- **B11 input (isom-scheme / isotriviality), axiomatized.** Given a Belyi pair `(X, f)`
over `K = ℂ` (with `X` a curve, `hf : IsBelyiMap K f`) spread out to a `SpreadOut` family,
together with the finiteness of iso-classes of its degree-`≤ d` Belyi fibres (supplied by
B9, `rigidity_finiteness k S.d`), the family is isotrivial on a dense open, so a closed
`ℚ̄`-point realises the geometric generic fibre and `(X, f)` descends to `ℚ̄`: it is
`DefinableOverPair k K X f`.

This isolates the single consequence of [Koeck2004, Thm 2.2] that B11 needs — the
finite-type isomorphism scheme with constructible (Chevalley) image — which is absent from
mathlib v4.32 (`references/converse-design.md` §4). It is the third and last sanctioned
axiom of the converse direction, alongside `rigidity_finiteness` (B9) and `belyi_spreadOut`
(B10(ii)).

**Soundness note.** The hypotheses `[IsCurveOver K X]` and `hf : IsBelyiMap K f` are
essential: they are precisely what make this axiom a *true* isolated statement (Belyi's
converse — every Belyi pair over `ℂ` descends to `ℚ̄`). Without them the axiom would apply
to an arbitrary morphism `f`, which is false: the current `SpreadOut` structure is *carrier
data* whose fields do not themselves constrain `(X, f)` (the honest generic-fibre-over-`ℚ̄(V)`
tie needs mathlib-absent infrastructure — this is what the de-axiomatization trackers #199
/#200 restore), so the mathematical content "`(X, f)` is Belyi" must be carried by `hf`
rather than by `S`. The finiteness hypothesis `hfin` is stated explicitly so that removing
this axiom reduces exactly to the pigeonhole `Finite (BelyiCover.Iso k d) ⇒ isotriviality`
(taxis #199).

Per taxis #201 this is stated as a `theorem` with `sorry` rather than an `axiom`, so that
the outstanding proof obligation is surfaced honestly (`sorryAx` in `#print axioms`, a
`sorry` warning at build) and tracked as a concrete goal. The proof is the research-grade
isomorphism-scheme / Chevalley-constructibility content scoped in issues #199 (the provable
pigeonhole nugget) and #200 (the full de-axiomatization). -/

base change to `K` recovers `(X, f)`.

Assembled from `belyi_spreadOut` (B10(ii)) and `definableOverPair_of_spreadOut` (B11).
This produces the **same** `DefinableOverPair` predicate the forward direction produces
(`Belyi/ForwardPair.lean`) and the main theorem (taxis #55) consumes. -/
